      The FileUploadExploitationLab (FUEL) provides a great variety of real-world and artificial unrestricted file upload vulnerability scenarios.
      <br>
      Each scenario implements a slightly different filter mechanism.
      You can find detailed information about the scenario in the scenario's /README.txt.
      <br>
      Files are always uploaded to /uploads/ and are directly accessible, i.e. /uploads/exploit.php.
