Scenario 9
==========

This scenario tries to verify the uploaded file is an image by checking its image size. 
However, a valid file may still contain executable code in text fields, such as EXIF data, that could be executed.

Thus, the attacker can upload a file `exploit.php` which is actually a real `.png` file with PHP code in its EXIF metadata.

exiftool - Comment = " <? php echo ’ START ’ . < CODE - EXECUTION > . /
’ END ’; ? > " < INPUT - IMAGE >. png -o polyglot . php
