Scenario 11
===========================

This scenario deactives the PHP interpreter on the `uploads/` directory. Thus, uploaded .php files will not be executed and `.htaccess` files cannot be uploaded.

However, the attacker can use a path traversal attack to upload files into a different directory which does not have these restrictions.
