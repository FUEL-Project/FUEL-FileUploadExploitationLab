Scenario 14
=================

This scenario simulates the analysis of an uploaded file for malicious file contents.
Between the file upload and the final analysis, the file might be accessible and executable by the attacker.

Thus the attacker can upload an executable malicious file (i.e. a PHP web shell) and immediately access it to execute it before it will be flagged and deleted.
