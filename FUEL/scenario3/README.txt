Scenario 3
===============

In this scenario, the $_FILES['fileToUpload']['type'] is validated against an array of allowed MIME types.

In order to bypass this server-side check, the attacker may choose a malicious file to upload and then change the file's `Content-Type` in the intercepted request to a permissable value. That way, they can pass the check while uploading a malicious file, such as `exploit.php` with Content-Type `image/png`.
