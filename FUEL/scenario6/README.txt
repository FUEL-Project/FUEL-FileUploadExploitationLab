Scenario 6
=============

This level URL decodes the provided filename and then splits the file extension at nullbytes, which may lead to vulnerabilities.

Insecure extension handling, especially by URL decoding and processing non-printable characters can become an issue.
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading a file with a filename that contains a NULL byte.
