Scenario 6
=============

The `AddHandler php-script .php` will execute all files with the PHP interpreter that contain `.php` in the file name. So while the application blocks the `.php` file extension, it does not block `exploit.php.png`.

Thus, an attacker can upload a malicious PHP file with the name `exploit.php.png`.
