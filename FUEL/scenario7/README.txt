Scenario 7
===============

This scenario blocks file uploads with the `php` extension. However, it does not block the upload of configuration files, such as .htaccess that change the behavior of the web server.

Thus, an attacker can upload a `.htaccess` file that will mark other extensions or files as executable by the PHP interpreter:

```
AddType application/x-httpd-php .myphp
```
