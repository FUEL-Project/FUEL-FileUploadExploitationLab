Scenario 8
============

In this scenario the application tries to remove dangerous file extensions from the file name, but does not perform this check in a recursive manner.

Thus, an attacker can still perform an unrestricted upload by nesting the file extension, i.e. `exploit.p.phphp`, which will result in `exploit.php`.
