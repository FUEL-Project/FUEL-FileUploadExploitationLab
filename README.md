FUEL-FileUploadExploitationLab
===============================
FUEL is an abbreviation for `File Upload Exploitation Lab` that aims to be a modular, extensible and simple framework to evaluate unrestricted file upload (UFU) vulnerabilities or vulnerability scanners.
It encompasses 15 unique UFU scenarios with bypassable file validation checks.
Detailed information about each scenario can be found within a scenario's README.

# Requirements

In order to use FUEL, you need the following software installed:

- Docker
- Docker compose extension
- Git

# Usage

Clone the repository to a directory on your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/FUEL-Project/FUEL-FileUploadExploitationLab.git
```

Change into the directory:

```
cd FUEL-FileUploadExploitationLab/FUEL/
```

And then bring up the file upload scenarios with docker compose:

```
sudo docker compose up --build
``` 

Each scenario is mapped to one port on the Docker host:

- Scenario 1 -> Port 10001
- Scenario 2 -> Port 10002
- Scenario 3 -> Port 10003
- Scenario N -> Port 10000 + N

You can find the main menue at any scenario's port in `/menue/`, i.e., 'http://localhost:10001/menue/'. 

To reset FUEL for a new evaluation round, it is enough to stop and restart the containers:

```
sudo docker compose down
sudo docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```
