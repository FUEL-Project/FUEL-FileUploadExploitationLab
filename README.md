FUEL-FileUploadExploitationLab
===============================
FUEL stands for File Upload Exploitation Lab and aims to be a common denominator to evaluate unrestricted file upload (UFU) vulnerability scanners.
It encompasses 13 different real-world and artificial file upload scenarios with varying filters.
Detailed information about each scenario can be found within a scenario's README.

# Requirements

In order to use FUEL, you need the following software installed:

- Docker
- Docker compose extension
- Git

# Usage

Clone the repository to a directory on your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/FUEL-Project/FUEL-FileUploadExploitationLab.git
```

Change into the directory:

```
cd FUEL-FileUploadExploitationLab/FUEL/
```

And then bring up the file upload scenarios with docker compose:

```
sudo docker compose up
``` 

Each scenario is mapped to one port on the Docker host:

- Scenario 1 -> Port 10001
- Scenario 2 -> Port 10002
- Scenario 3 -> Port 10003
- Scenario N -> Port 10000 + N

You can find the main menue at any scenario's port in `/menue/`, i.e., 'http://localhost:10001/menue/'.
